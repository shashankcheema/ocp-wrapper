Feature/Criteria	Datadog	Instana
Logging	Advanced log management with extensive search and analytics capabilities. Integrates seamlessly with various logging systems.	Focused on automatic log correlation with traces and metrics. Good for identifying issues in distributed environments.
Metrics Collection	Extensive metrics collection with a strong emphasis on aggregation and visualization. Supports custom metrics.	Real-time metrics collection with automatic context and dependency mapping, especially strong in microservices architectures.
Health Checks	Provides APIs and integrations for custom health checks and monitoring.	Has automated anomaly detection and health check features for monitored applications.
Alerting	Robust alerting capabilities with a wide range of integrations for notifications. Allows complex alert configurations.	Intelligent alerting based on machine learning, minimizing false positives. Easy integration with existing alerting infrastructures.
Job Scheduling Monitoring	Offers capabilities to monitor cron jobs and scheduled tasks, especially through integrations and custom metrics.	Provides insights into scheduled tasks, although it might be less straightforward than Datadog for cron job specific monitoring.
Resource Utilization	Detailed resource utilization metrics, with capabilities for historical data analysis and forecasting.	Provides real-time resource utilization insights with a focus on automatic interpretation and anomaly detection.
Tracing	Offers comprehensive distributed tracing features with detailed performance insights.	Specializes in automated distributed tracing with minimal configuration, focusing on the most impactful information.
Audit Logging	Supports audit logging with integrations to external systems for comprehensive tracking.	Also supports audit logs, but with a stronger focus on automatic correlation with other monitoring data.
Custom Scripts/Tools Integration	Highly customizable with support for integrating custom scripts and external tools.	Offers some customization options, but generally more focused on out-of-the-box automation and ease of use.
Usability with OCP	Seamless integration with OCP, offering detailed monitoring and visualization tools tailored for containerized environments.	Effective in monitoring containerized environments with automated discovery and monitoring of microservices in OCP.
Ease of Use	User-friendly interface, but may require more initial setup and tuning.	Known for its ease of use and minimal configuration, especially in dynamic and complex environments.


Currently, there is no established monitoring system for our batch models; monitoring and addressing issues is a manual process.

Regarding our existing dashboard, it should enable us to oversee specific elements of our batch models' infrastructure.

Monitoring capabilities include:

Total job count within a specific namespace or cluster
Number of successful jobs
Number of failed jobs
Failure reasons, such as:
Out of Memory (OOM)
CrashLoopBackOff
Container restarts
Errors during execution ("Bad Phase")
Ranking of cron jobs based on execution frequency
Resource usage by cron jobs
Identified Challenges:

Missing monitoring agents in ME and MT clusters
Inadequate configuration of teams or groups
Lack of proper assignment groups for models
Planned Actions:

Collaborate with the OCP team to ensure correct installation of monitoring agents
Determine and set an appropriate data retention period
Integrate OCP events, particularly those with Error and Warning messages, into our dashboards for enhanced oversight.
